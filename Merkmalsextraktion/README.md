Code Enhancements V2:
1.Image normalization:

   -We improved the image normalization method to accommodate images with different pixel value ranges. Now, images are normalized to the    
   range    from 0 to 1.

2.Comments and readability:

   -We added more comments to make the code easier to understand and use.
